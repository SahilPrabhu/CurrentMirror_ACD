# Current_Mirror_ACD

## Problem Statement
<br>
Design a common source stage with current source load (implement using current mirror) for the following specifications: <br>
  Gain (Av) = 20 <br>
  Power budget < 20mW <br>
  Supply voltage (Vdd) = 1.8v <br>
  Threshold Voltage (Vth) = 0.5 <br>
  UnCox =  <br>
  Output Swing Limit = 0.5 peak to peak <br>
  λ<sub>1</sub> = 0.1V<sup>-1</sup> <br>
  λ<sub>2</sub> = 0.2V<sup>-1</sup>
